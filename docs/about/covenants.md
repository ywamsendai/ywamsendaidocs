# YWAM's Legacy Words and Covenants

## YWAM Legacy Words

YWAM’s identity and mission is further clarified by what we know as the “*Four Legacy Words*” given by God to Loren Cunningham through the years. These are the major words of the Lord, which over our history have guided us and shaped our inheritance as a mission.

1. [The Covenantal Vision of the Waves](https://www.ywamvalues.com/uploads/1/1/6/5/1165317/legacy_word_1__the_vision_of_the_waves_%E2%80%93_1956.pdf), which Loren received in June of 1956 in the Bahamas shortly before his 21st birthday.

2. [The Call to Disciple Nations through the Seven Spheres of Society](https://www.ywamvalues.com/uploads/1/1/6/5/1165317/legacy_word_2__the_spheres_of_influence_%E2%80%93_1975_doc.pdf)
