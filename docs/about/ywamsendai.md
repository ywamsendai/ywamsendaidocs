# YWAM Sendai: The Tohoku Charter

## I. Our Identity: The Mission Hub

Since our pioneering in 2018, YWAM Sendai has been called to serve as the **Mission Hub for the Tohoku region**. We are more than a single base; we are a spiritual engine room designed to fuel the expansion of the Kingdom across every prefecture in North Japan.

As a **Training Center**, our primary work is the formation of the missionary. Through the Discipleship Training School (DTS) and secondary schools of the University of the Nations, we offer a space where believers are not only equipped with ministry skills but are invited into a transformative "walk with God" that is deep, resilient, and rooted.

## II. The Tohoku Vision: Every Prefecture

Our apostolic mandate is clear: **to see a vibrant YWAM presence and ministry team established in every one of the six prefectures of Tohoku**. Sendai stands as the "Mother Base," providing the resources, training, and spiritual oversight necessary to pioneer new teams. We believe that Tohoku will be reached not by a single large organization, but by a "constellation" of small, faithful communities rooted in local soil, connected by a shared vision and a common heart.

## III. Our Method: Deep Contextualization

We believe that for the Gospel to truly take root in Japanese soil, it must shed its Western "scaffolding" and find a native expression. We are committed to **Contextualized Mission**, seeking creative and traditional ways to convey the beauty of Christ that resonate with the Japanese soul.

We move away from "imported" religious styles, instead embracing:

- **The Aesthetic of Beauty:** Using the arts, liturgy, and the sensory richness of the "Great Tradition" to speak to the Japanese appreciation for *Yūgen* (mystery) and *Wa* (harmony).

- **Incarnational Presence:** Valuing the "slow mission" of presence, language fluency (*Kenosis*), and the sanctification of the ordinary.

- **Historical Continuity:** Presenting Christianity not as a modern Western invention, but as an ancient "Way" that has been part of the Japanese story for centuries.

## IV. Our Heart: The Ecumenical Bridge

YWAM Sendai is a **House of Unity**. We believe that the evangelization of Japan requires the "two lungs" of the Church—East and West—breathing together.

### 1. The Home of the Great Tradition
We are a home for YWAMers from all major Christian streams—**Orthodox, Catholic, Anglican, and Evangelical/Pentecostal**. We believe that our diversity is not a weakness but a reflection of the fullness of the Body of Christ.

### 2. The Foundation of Unity
Our unity is not based on a "lowest common denominator," but on the robust foundation of:

- **The Nicene Creed:** The shared confession of the historic, apostolic faith.

- **The Statement of Purpose, Core Beliefs and Foundational Values of YWAM:** This shared purpose and our YWAM beliefs and values are the guiding principles for both the past and future growth of our mission.

- **Traditional Values:** A commitment to the historic Christian consensus on the sanctity of life, marriage, and the body.

- **Mutual Honour:** A "culture of honour" that respects the sacramental integrity of each person's tradition.

### 3. Bridge Building
As a "Bridge Builder," we actively seek and encourage church unity across Sendai and Tohoku. We serve the local church in all its forms, believing that YWAM exists to strengthen the local Body, not to replace it.

## V. The Rule of Life: How We Walk

To sustain this vision, we live by a shared **Rule of Life**. We recognize that a missionary's "doing" must flow from their "being." We commit ourselves to:

- **Theosis/Sanctification:** The lifelong journey of being transformed into the likeness of God through His grace and the Holy Spirit.

- **Rhythm:** A daily life anchored in common prayer, the study of the Word, and the celebration of God’s presence.

- **Submission:** Walking in accountability with our leaders, our peers, and our local church expressions.

## VI. An Invitation to the Way

We invite the pioneers, the contemplatives, the artists, and the scholars. We invite those who love the "fire" of the Great Commission and those who love the "depth" of the Ancient Paths.

Join us in Sendai as we labour to see the light of Christ shine in every corner of Tohoku—until every prefecture has a witness, every heart has a hope, and the "Way of Jesus" becomes a home for the Japanese people.
