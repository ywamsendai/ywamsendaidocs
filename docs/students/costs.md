# School Costs

If you're accepted, please note the following costs (subject to change):

## 3-month DTS Lecture Phase/3-month DBS

- **Tuition fee:** ¥300,000 (tax included). This includes lectures, administration, and refreshments.
- **Accommodation:** ¥120,000 for the 3 months.
- **Food and local transport:** Budget an extra ¥150,000

## DTS Outreach and Total Cost

The **total cost for the whole 5-month DTS will therefore be around ¥970,000**
