## What do course fees cover?

### DTS Lecture Phase / Secondary School

For the three-month DTS Lecture Phase or Secondary School (such as DBS), here are the following costs involved:

**Tuition fee:  ¥300,000 (tax included)**
This includes lectures, administration, and refreshments.

**DTS+DBS COMBO DISCOUNT:** If you apply for both schools, you will receive a **¥50,000 discount** on the DBS tuition fee (pending successful completion of DTS).

**Accommodation: ¥120,000**
This includes bedding, utilities, and wifi.

**Food, local transportation, and personal expenses: Budget around ¥150,000**
There will be a mix of shared meals (you will be asked for a contribution towards costs), eating out, and times to provide for yourself. You will also need to pay for train fares to travel to ministry or church. You may also want extra money for personal expenses. This amount is an estimated budget.

### Outreach Phase

For courses that include an Outreach Phase (such as DTS), the estimated cost will be communicated with you ahead of time. This varies according to the location and length of the Outreach. 

**Estimated budget: ¥400,000**
This generally covers transportation, main meals, accommodation, and any other necessary expenses. Personal expenses and any vaccination costs are not included in communicated Outreach Cost.

### Total DTS Cost

Just to make it clear, it is necessary to complete both the Lecture and Outreach phases of the DTS. So **please budget for around ¥970,000 for the duration of the school**.

## How do I pay?

You can find details on how to make Tuition Fee payments on the [Payment page](../about/payment.md).

**Please note that accommodation, food, and Outreach costs are to be given in CASH ONLY.**
