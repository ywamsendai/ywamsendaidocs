Housing is generally basic, but comfortable! All students will live in shared housing with other students and have access to a small kitchen and bathroom. There will also be air-conditioning or heating, depending on the season.

Surrounding the housing are rice fields and views of the mountains, which facilitates quiet times. The one downside is it is around a 20min walk to the nearest convenience store and train station (which has easy access to central Sendai), and 30mins to the supermarket.

### How do I do laundry?

The housing includes a washing machine and space to hang dry. There is also coin-laundry facilities, which includes dryers, around 15min walk away.

### Can I live in my own housing if I want to?

DTS: We are sorry, but no. As the DTS programme is a “live-learn environment,” attendees may not live outside of the DTS community.

## School Life

### Where is the school located?

Located in the largest city in the Tohoku (North-East) region called Sendai, the school is located in the quiet suburbs of Ayashi. On one side is the Zao mountain range, on the other side is the bustling central downtown of Sendai. Further past downtown is the ocean. So mountains, forests, city, and ocean are all within easy access!

### How many hours of class do I have?

Generally, if it is a bilingual course, lecture time is around 16 hours per week. If monolingual, lecture is around 12 hours. In general, you can expect to be involved in lectures, processing time, intercession & prayer, worship, etc. from 8am to 5pm on weekdays (schedule still to be finalised).

### What is work duty and how much of it do I have?

Work duty is a way for students to serve and give back to the DTS. Typically a student will spend two hours per day helping an essential need. Many students end up helping out in the kitchen, or taking care of the grounds, etc.

### How do I get around?

Within walking distance (20 to 30min) from the DTS housing are convenience stores, coin laundry, supermarkets, post office, restaurants, and train station. There are buses that go to a nearby mall, hot springs, and a public swimming pool. The train gives easy access to downtown Sendai, mountain walks, ocean-side towns, and the local airport.

We can give you directions closer to your arrival, and will arrange staff to meet you.
