## Housing

### Is housing provided?

Yes. Housing is provided and paid for separate from tuition fees.

### What is housing like?

Housing is generally basic, but comfortable! All students will live in shared housing with other students and have access to a small kitchen and bathroom. There will also be air-conditioning or heating, depending on the season.

Surrounding the housing are quiet residential areas and a view of the mountains, which facilitates quiet times. There are convenience stores, a supermarket, restaurants, post office, library, coin laundry within walking distance, and the nearby train station has easy access to central Sendai.

### How do I do laundry?

The housing includes a washing machine and space to hang dry. There is also coin-laundry facilities, which includes dryers, around 15min walk away.

### Can I live in my own housing if I want to?

We are sorry, but no. As the DTS and DBS programmes are “live-learn environments,” attendees may not live outside of the school community.

## School Life

### Where is the school located?

Located in the largest city in the Tohoku (North-East) region called Sendai, the school is located in the quiet suburbs of Ayashi. On one side is the Zao mountain range, on the other side is the bustling central downtown of Sendai. Further past downtown is the ocean. So mountains, forests, city, and ocean are all within easy access!

### How many hours of class do I have?

Generally, if it is a bilingual course, lecture time is around 16 hours per week. If monolingual, lecture is around 12 hours. In general, you can expect to be involved in lectures, processing time, intercession & prayer, worship, etc. from 8am to 5pm on weekdays (schedule still to be finalised).

### What is "work duty" and how much of it do I have?

Work duty is a way for students to serve and give back to the community. Typically a student will spend two hours per day helping an essential need. Many students end up helping out in the kitchen, or taking care of the grounds, etc.

### How do I get around?

Within walking distance (10 to 20 min) from the DTS housing are convenience stores, coin laundry, supermarkets, post office, restaurants, and train station. There are buses that go to a nearby mall, hot springs, and a public swimming pool. The train gives easy access to downtown Sendai, mountain walks, ocean-side towns, and the local airport.

### Is food provided for me?

Some shared meals are to be paid for separate from the tuition fees. These meals will be prepared both by staff and students (work duties). We will provide more information closer to the start of the school.

### Will food be available for people with dietary restrictions and/or allergies?

Please tell us any dietary restrictions and/or allergies when applying for a course so we can keep this in mind when meals are prepared.

### How do I receive mail?

We will provide you with a postal address you can use to receive mail or packages during your stay.

### Are there any Health Care facilities?

There are multiple health care facilities in the local area that can be accessed by walking, bus, train, or taxi. We can provide more information on arrival. If you have a medical emergency while here, please call 119 immediately, tell them *kyūkyū*, and then tell YWAM Sendai staff when possible.

### What can I do during free time?

In your free time, you have many opportunities to engage in local life. If you're interested in nature, you can finds trails through mountains and forests, or explore the seaside towns. If you are looked for something more urban, you can explore downtown Sendai--visiting the many coffee shops, stores, game arcades, or museums and other tourist attractions. There is also a zoo and an aquarium! You can also sample the famous local foods such as *gyūtan* (beef tongue), *zunda* (sweet edemame) products, and *sasa-kamaboko* (fishcake). The ramen and seafood are also pretty good!

### What if I observe or experience abuse?

If for any reason you feel you are being abused in any category please reach out immediately to the YWAM Sendai leaders, or send an email to [ywamsendai.students@gmail.com](mailto:ywamsendai.students@gmail.com).

## Preparation & Arrival

### What should I pack?

You will need to pack your belongings in a way that you will be able to personally carry them to the school location, as well as throughout any Outreach. **You may not be able to leave anything in Sendai during Outreach Phase.**

Especially because of carrying the luggage around during Outreach, we ask that you carry no more than two pieces of luggage:

- A small everyday backpack
- A hiking backpack at a size you can comfortably carry, or a small to medium-sized case with a volume of no more than 80L (**no large cases please!**)

There is also a Japanese encephalitis vaccine that you may choose to consider, though Japanese encephalitis is extremely rare in the region we are based in.

### Is there anything I need to do before arriving?

Make sure you have paid any fees due, prior to any deadlines. 

If you don't know already, it is probably worth learning a bit about [Japanese culture](../community/culture.md) and learning some basic [Japanese](../community/language.md) before arrival!

### When can I plan on arriving and departing?

You will be provided with accommodation from the school's Arrival Date up until the Departure Date. Any accommodation outside of these dates will be your responsibility.

### To where and when shall I book my transport tickets?

If you are coming from overseas, we recommend choosing a flight route that arrives at Sendai International Airport. If you are coming from within Japan, or are arriving at a different airport (such as in Tokyo), we can give you directions closer to your arrival, and will arrange staff to meet you.
