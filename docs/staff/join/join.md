# Join Us!

If you feel you may be called to reach and love the Japanese in Japan, then we would love to have you consider joining us!

As a staff at YWAM Sendai, you will become an integral part of a pioneering missional community where your gifting and personality will shape our culture and influence how we reach the Japanese.

Above all, you should come ready to pursue God in prayer and worship and be committed to developing a naturally supernatural lifestyle. You should also be flexible as this is a pioneering YWAM community, not just a gathering of individual missionaries.

## The Process

**Note:** You will have had to have completed a YWAM DTS somewhere in the world to start the application process.

* First, explore this wiki to find information on [staff expectations](staffing.md), [YWAM values](../about/values.md), [fundraising](fundraising.md), [Japanese culture](../community/culture.md), [Japanese language learning tips](../community/language.md) etc.

* Connect with us via [Discord](../community/communication.md), introduce yourself, and ask us questions.

* We will send you a **Staff Application** form. Once you complete this, we will send **Character Reference** forms to three people that know you.

* Once we have received the references, we will set up a video call with two or three of us so that we to get to know each other more.

* After the call, our Staffing team will pray and discuss about whether we feel this is where God wants you to be. We will then let you know if we are happy continuing with the process, or not.

* If we feel peace about moving forward, we will send you a **Medical and Criminal Background Check** form.

* Once we have received this completed form, we will dialogue with you about any questions or concerns we have about what you submitted in order to make sure you have the care you need when serving with us.

* If we feel peace with you joining us, you will then start [fundraising](fundraising.md)! This is also a good time to get stuck into [language study](../community/language.md), if you haven't already.

* Once you have reached at least the Minimum Support Level of financial support, you can join our team! If you are in need of a visa to live in Japan, we will start the [visa process](visaApply.md)!

You will be guided through this process and you are free to ask questions anytime!
