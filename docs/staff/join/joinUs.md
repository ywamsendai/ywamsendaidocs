# Join Us!

If you feel you may be called to reach and love the Japanese in Japan, then we would love to have you consider joining us!

As a staff at YWAM Sendai, you will become an integral part of a pioneering missional community where your gifting and personality will shape our culture and influence how we reach the Japanese.

Above all, you should come ready to pursue God in prayer and worship and be committed to developing a naturally supernatural lifestyle. You should also be flexible as this is a pioneering YWAM community, not just a gathering of individual missionaries.

## The Process

You will be guided through this process and you are free to ask questions anytime!

Before you begin, first explore this online documentation to find information on [staff expectations](../staffing.md), [YWAM values](../../about/values.md), [fundraising](fundraising.md), [Japanese culture](../../community/culture.md), [Japanese language learning tips](../../community/language.md) etc, and connect with us via [Discord](../../community/communication.md), introduce yourself, and ask us questions.

**Note:** You will have had to have successfully completed a YWAM DTS somewhere in the world to start the application process.

### 1 Apply

Once you feel ready, [apply here](https://www.ywamsendai.org/en/apply/)! Once we have received your application, we may ask clarifying questions about anything you have submitted.

### 2 Interview

If we feel happy to move forward, we will set up a video interview with you in order to get to know you better and better discern your suitability for the staff position.

### 3 Decision

Again, if we feel happy so far, we will contact your provided references to gain a fuller perspective and to confirm what we have learnt about you up to this point. After we have received this feedback, we will let you know our decision as soon as possible.

### 4 Preparation

If accepted, you will then start [fundraising](fundraising.md)! This is also a good time to get stuck into [language study](../../community/language.md), if you haven't already.

Once you have reached at least the Minimum Support Level of financial support, you can join our team! If you are in need of a visa to live in Japan, we will start the [visa process](visaApply.md)!
