# In An Emergency

Japan is a country that experiences natural phenomena on a regular basis, such as earthquakes and typhoons. Sometimes, these can cause damage which can lead to emergency situations. This page details some ways we can be prepared.

## Warning App

Make sure you have a disaster early-warning app installed on your phone. Yurekuru Call is a recommended one in English.

## Evacuation

In the case of the seminary being damaged, you may have to move to an evacuation centre.

In this case, your closest evacuation centre is the **Hirose Junior High School (1 Chome-9-1 Ayashichuo, Aoba Ward, Sendai, Miyagi 989-3128).**

## Tips for Earthquakes

- Keep calm & protect yourself under something large like a table or (if in bedroom) under a pillow or duvet blanket
- Check fire sources (such as stove); if fire has started, remain calm and put it out
- Be careful of fallen objects or broken glass
- Make sure you have a way out of the building when shaking stops
- If you are outside, stay away from concrete walls or other objects that may fall
- In the event of a large fire as a result of earthquake, assemble in the temporary evacuation area nearest you (as stated above)
- Make sure everyone is accounted for
- Get the right information about courses of action from local authorities, radio, TV, fire station, etc.
