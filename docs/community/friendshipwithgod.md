# Friendship With God

Our relationship with God is the most precious gift we have as believers. This relationship should never be negatively affected by being too busy with ministries or other YWAM scheduled events and meetings. We want to foster a culture of going deeper with God, both as individuals and as a community. We want to be a community that moves out of a place of rest, filled with joy and peace. Plus, we will only replicate in Japan what we ourselves carry!

As individuals, each staff and student is encouraged to invest time daily in fostering friendship with God through intimacy with the Holy Spirit. Since everyone relates with God in different ways depending on personality and Christian background, there is no prescription for how to foster this friendship. But sometimes we need help and guidance, so we wanted to share a few ways to help.

As a community, we try to incorporate different forms of worship and prayer during weekly corporate times. But try also to explore different ways that can assist you in deepening your friendship with God, personally.

We have broken these spiritual disciplines into ancient categories believers have used down through the centuries: vocal, meditative, and contemplative..

## Vocal

Vocal prayer is prayer where our mind is fully engaged. (Picture: talking with a loved one.)

- You can use the Lord's Prayer as a basis for your own times of prayer and worship
- Journaling
- Writing psalms to God
- Liturgy
- Intercession (praying for others)
- Petition (praying for yourself)
- Thanksgiving
- Praise
- Confession
- Lamentation (pouring out your heart, acknowledging difficulties)

## Meditative

Meditative prayer is prayer where we use our thinking and imagination to reflect on God and what He is saying to us. (Picture: reflecting on a love letter written to you.)

- Bible reading
- Lectio Divina
- Prayer beads
- Praying in tongues
- Creating prayerful art
- Soaking prayer (meditative music listening)

## Contemplative

Contemplative prayer is prayer where we suppress our thinking and imagination and silently gaze upon God. (Picture: gazing into the eyes of a loved one.)

- Centering prayer
- Contemplating God in nature
