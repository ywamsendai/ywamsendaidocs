# YWAM Japan Area Circle Team (ACT)

## Areas and their Omega Zones

YWAM has developed a mapping initiative called “4K” which aims to help Christian workers all over the world better understand where the spiritual and physical needs are.

The world has been divided up into around 4,200 Omega Zones. These are determined by population, geopolitical divisions, availability of the Gospel, spiritual needs, and basic life needs.

A vision of YWAM is to establish ministries and disciple-making movements (church planting) in all of these 4,200 Omega Zones!

Omega Zones that are geographically close together are grouped into Areas. These 74 Areas have Area Circle Teams (ACTs) over them that come together to help see new works pioneered within the Omega Zones within their Area.

## Japan Area Circle Team

Japan is one Area which includes [53 Omega Zones](https://www.ywamjapan.org/en/omegazones/).

Over the Japan Area is the YWAM Japan Area Circle Team.
