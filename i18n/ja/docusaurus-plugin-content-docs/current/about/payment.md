# Payments & Donations

The preferred method of making staff contributions, school fee payments, or donations is a bank transfer from your bank account to YWAM Sendai's Japan Post Bank account. The easiest way to send money is via your own Japan Post Bank account. The payment can be done either online via Japan Post Bank Direct (ゆうちょダイレクト) or via a Japan Post Bank ATM.

The YWAM Sendai JP Bank account number is: **10140-65305041**

**Online** (Japanese only):

Using this method, you can send us money without any fees!

You can find directions on how to make a transfer [here.](https://www.jp-bank.japanpost.jp/direct/pc/guide/dr_pc_gd_densin.html)

**ATM**:

Please note there will be a fee of ¥152 per transfer.

* At the ATM, insert your cashcard or bank book, then press the English button
* Next, press Remittance and enter your PIN number
* Input the first 5 numbers of the account number: 10140
* Next, input the next 8 numbers: 65305041
* Input the amount you wish to send
* Confirm
* You will be given an option to save this account. Please do this, as it will make this process quick and easy from now on.
* From now on, after pressing Remittance, you can choose the saved account, then input the amount.

If you need help with this, the Staff Contributions role can assist you, so please don't hesitate to ask!
